<!--

    Very simple model as could be used for reading from a plain HTML form for server-side validation

-->
<fore-model id="record">

    <fore-instance id="default">
        <data>
            <param1>foo</param1>
            <param2>bar</param2>
            <param3>5.0</param3>
        </data>
    </fore-instance>


    <!--
        Context: there's only one instance here so the evaluation context will be
        `data`.

        In general the evaluation context is always the first instance in document order by default.

        We decided to use a map of instances to access all instances like e.g. `$instances?myInst`.

        In XForms the root node of the instance in context is always ignored in path expressions.
        So `param1` is the same as `instances?default/param1. The context is the rootnode of the instance NOT the
        `fore-instance` element.
