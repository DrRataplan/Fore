<div class="topic">
    <div class="hint">
        For a user or even form writer this topic is of minor interest. However to enhance Fore or build
        your own components you should have an understanding of the inner workings.
    </div>

    <h1>Architecture</h1>

    <p>Fore is a forms framework specifically built for and with <a href="https://exist-db.org" target="_blank">eXist-db</a>.</p>

    <p>It distributes form-processing between client and server for maximum security and flexibility.</p>

    <img src="architecture-1.png" alt="Fore architecture" style="width:600px;"/>
    <figure>high-level architecture</figure>

    <p>The browser client talks to eXist-db via AJAX calls. The server will answer with JSON data
        to inform about value and state changes.</p>

    <div class="note">Eventually we'll add push capabilities to the server as we see fit. However
    usual form applications rarely need this feature.</div>

    <h2>XForms and Fore</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/xformsusers/wiki/XForms_2.0" target="_blank">XForms</a> architecture has been designed by clever people more than a decade ago. It has been battle-tested in
        extremely complex scenarios and there's hardly any other form framework in the world that can compete. However
        it also employs some complexity and learning-curve that is not easy to master for everyone. </p>

    <p>
        Fore will stay close to the overall XForms architecture and even try to keep element names and attributes whereever
        it makes sense. We hope to thereby make it easier for experienced XForms users to do the migration to Fore.
    </p>

    <h2>The XForms MVC</h2>

    <p>
        The following graphic shows the main building blocks 'model', 'UI' and 'actions'. These modules together make up
        the MVC architecture of XForms.
    </p>

    <img src="mvc.png" style="width:600px;" alt="MVC model"/>
    <figure>XForms MVC</figure>

    <p>
        The model represents the data and it's constraints. The UI binds to the model via the <a href="xf-bind.html">bind</a> elements. Actions can be
        fired by the UI or the model to change the state of the model which in turn will trigger the UI to update itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Client- and Server Data Model</h2>

    <p>
        The primary goal of the new forms solution is to edit XML data. However browsers do not well with XML
        natively (except for XHTML). Furthermore JSON has made the race in the client-side world and the use of XML and XPath
        has always had a niche-existence at best. It's currently very unlikely that this is going to change.
    </p>

    <p>
        XPath (and XQuery) are the powertools of XML but they are also not (really) present in the browser. To circumvent
        these problems and give each side what it deserves we need to introduce some mapping between the worlds.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the server we deal with data instances which represent XML documents. On the client we'd like to
        consume some JSON data to render and update our UI. A plain XML to JSON conversion is possible but still leaves
        us with the problem of resolving path expressions and map those from XPath to e.g. JSONPath. This involves some
        complexity and potential for errors.
    </p>

    <p>Fore uses the bindings as intermediates between the XML and JSON world. The client only knows about
    bind ids and states while the server will translate those to XPathes that point to nodes in XML. The client
    gets a JSON representation that mirrors the structure of the <a href="xf-bind.html"><code>xf-bind</code></a> elements.</p>

    <p>The following graphic shows this in more detail.</p>

    <div class="note">
        On the client-side we talk about <b>binding pathes</b> while on the server those get translated to XPathes.
    </div>

    <h2>Distribution of functionality</h2>

    <p>The folowing table shows roughly how the functionalities of client and server are distributed.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <td>Client</td>
            <td>Server</td>
