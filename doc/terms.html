    <h1>Terms</h1>

    <p>This document explains some of the terms used in Fore.</p>

    <h2><a name="bindingAttributes">Binding Attributes</a></h2>
    <p>Binding AttribuTes are the <code>ref</code> and <code>set</code> attributes of <code>xf-bind</code> as
    well as the <code>bind</code> attribute on UI Controls. They establish a data-binding between a source (the element
    having the binding attribute) and a target (where the bind points to).</p>

    <h2><a name="bindobjects">Bind Objects</a></h2>
    <p>At init-time of a form all <code>xf-bind</code> elements are 'unrolled' to create corresponding <b>bind objects</b>.
    A bind object can be seen as an instanciation of a bind for a single bound node in the data. For single-node bindings
    each <code>xf-bind</code> will correspond to one bind object. For bindings that bind to a set of items for each
    of the items a bind object is created. Bind objects are serialized as a JSON structure that represents the UI Model.</p>

    <h2>Binding Path</h2>
    <p>Bindings Pathes are generated by the client when the user interacts with the form. They consist of the
    id of the binding along with an index if the binding refers to repeated data. The concept is explained <a
                href="architecture.html#hostuimodel">here</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="hostmodel">Host Model</a></h2>
    <p>Refers to <code>xf-model</code> element and its descendants. This is the actual model being processed
    on the server-side by eXist-db to recalculate and revalidate the data. The host model is not transferred to the
        client but translated into a JSON structure that will make up the <a href="#uimodel">UI model</a></p>

    <h2><a name="uimodel">UI Model</a></h2>
    <p>The UI Model is powered by a JSON structure that reflects the structure and state of the bindings on
    the server-side. The UI Model is all the client knows about. The client will mutate this structure when
    values are changed, items get inserted or deleted. Changes will be logged and send back to the server.</p>
