# Fore documentation

## Introducting Fore

 > "fore" - something that occupies a front position" - Merriam Webster dictionary

XForms has a home in eXist-db for long years. And it has it's users though it's complexities are not always easy to
 master. On the other hand XForms is unbeatable when it comes to editing complex XML structures. 

Due to library conflicts the betterFORM XForms engine cannot be continued without causing massive effort. Our second
 option XSLTForms is also not maintained very actively lately. To offer a migration path to our XForms users and also
  to simplify the authoring we decided to have a complete new approach to it.

Fore will be an integral part of eXist-db and make maximum use of its facilities. Ease-of-use is a primary goal even
 if that means to take freedom from the XForms specifications. 

The main building blocks of XForms like model, instances, binding, submissions etc. will continue to exist in Fore though
the concrete element names and the syntax might diverge from it.
