    <h1>xf-submission</h1>

    <p>A <code>xf-submission</code> is triggered by a <code>xf-submit</code> action.</p>

    <p>The submission will select the data for submission, check their validity, serialize and pass them
    to the action handler.</p>

    <p>The submission also deals with the response received from the action handler.</p>

    <div class="hint">
        Fore submission will significantly differ from XForms which has a complex set of options. Fore profits from
        eXist-db here as we can always pass the submitted data to an XQuery function to do whatever complex operations
        we might have. There is no need to build this directly into the framework.
    </div>

    <h2>Submission Processing</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Submission is triggered by <code>xf-submit</code> action</li>
        <li>The <code>ref</code> attribute will evaluated to determine the target instance data.</li>
        <li>If <code>nonrelevant</code> evaluates to <code>false()</code> all nonrelevant nodes are filtered
        from the selected instance. </li>
        <li>The instance is recalculated and revalidated.</li>
        <li>If errors occur the relevant alerts are send back to the client and submission stops</li>
        <li>If validation is successful the data are serialized and passed to the action handler</li>
        <li>If submission generates an error the <code>xf-submit-error</code> child element is triggered (if any).</li>
        <li>If submission was successful the response is parsed and and processed depending on the replace mode.
            <ul>
                <li>if <code>replace='all'</code> then submission response is passed back to client directly</li>
                <li>if <code>replace='instance'</code> then submission response is parsed and replaces the
                    current instance or the node specified in <code>targetref</code>. This might also point to
                    another instance replacing their entire content.
                </li>
                <li>if <code>replace='none'</code> the response is ignored.</li>
                <li>if <code>replace='text'</code> the response replaces the targetnode's textnode</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <code>xf-submit-done</code> child element is triggered.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>xf-submit-done</h2>

    <p>The <code>xf-submit-done</code> element is an action handler which is triggered on successful execution
    of a submission. It is usually used to send messages to the user or trigger loading of another URL. You can
    think of this element as an trigger for actions.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>
    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-submission>
                <xf-submit-done>
                    <xf-message>Your data have been sent</xf-message>
                </xf-submit-done>
            </xf-submission>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>This will display a message to the user after submission was successful</p>


    <h2>xf-submit-error</h2>

    <p>Triggers the <code>xf-submit-error</code> element when submission fails for some reason.</p>

    <h2>Chaining Submissions</h2>

    <p>A powerful feature is submission chaining. This allows to trigger another submission dependent on the outcome
    of the first.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>
    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-submission id="first" targetref="$instances?preprocessed" replace="instance">
                <xf-submit-done>
                    <xf-submit submission="second"></xf-submit>
                </xf-submit-done>
            </xf-submission>

            <xf-submission id="second" ref="$instance?preprocessed"></xf-submission>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>In the example above the first submission will preprocess the instance data and store them in an instance named
    'preprocessed'. After that has successfully been done the second submission is called.</p>

    <p>Submission chaining can be done in either <code>xf-submit-done</code> and <code>xf-submit-error</code> elements.</p>
