    <h1>The Model</h1>

    <p>The model describes the data, their loading and storing
        and the constraints to be enforced during validation.</p>

    <h2>Client and Server Models</h2>

    <p>There's a model both on the client and the server. However they are not the same and not even carry
    the same amount of information. To establish a clear distinction between the two i'll call the server-side model the
    <b>host model</b> and the client-side model the <b>UI model</b>.</p>

    <p>It is the host model that a form author will write to define the involved data, constraints and
    submissions. The host model uses elements with a 'xf-' prefix. The UI model will be created by the backend
    at runtime.</p>

    <div class="hint">The host model will never be exposed to the client. When a new form session starts
    the <code>xf-model</code> element is filtered out before returning the embedding HTML page.</div>

    <h2>xf-model Overview</h2>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <td>Element</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Cardinality</td>
        </thead>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="xf-model.html">xf-model</a></td>
            <td>Container element defining the data, constraints and submissions of a form</td>
            <td>
                exactly one
                <div class="note">
                    In XForms a form can hold any number of model elements. However in practice more than one
                    model have barely been needed during years of XForms usage. Extending this later is still possible but
                    will be driven by necessity.
