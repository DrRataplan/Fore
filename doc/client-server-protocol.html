    <h1>Client Server Protocol</h1>

    <p>This document describes the JSON structures that are used in client-server communication.</p>

    <p>One central problem with a distributed architecture is the syncing of identities between server and client.
        When a data item (aka node) changes on either side the change needs to be propagated to the other side.</p>

    <p>Either client and server have their 'preferred' data formats. On the server we'd like to deal mainly with XML
        while JSON is better suited on the client.</p>

    <p>Fore uses <code>xf-bind</code> ids to map between the <a href="terms.html#uimodel">UI Model</a> and
        <a href="terms.html#hostmodel">Host Model</a>. For more detail refer to
        <a href="architecture.html">architecture</a>.</p>

    <p>The involved structures are best described in context with their occurrence during the lifecycle of a form session.</p>

    <h2>Initing the  UI Model</h2>

    <p>After initial load of a form in the browser it will send an 'init' request to load the UI Model.</p>

    <p>The response from the server will contain a structural copy of the <code>xf-bind</code> elements represented in JSON.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-model>
                <xf-instance>
                    <data>
                        <greeting>hello</greeting>
                        <audience>world</audience>
                    </data>
                </xf-instance>

                <xf-bind id="b-greeting" ref="greeting" requred="true()"></xf-bind>
                <xf-bind id="b-audience" ref="audience"><xf-bind>
            </xf-model>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>The resulting JSON will look like this:</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            [
                {
                    "bind":{
                        "id":"b-greeting",
                        "required":true,
                        "value":"hello"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "bind": {
                        "id":"b-audience",
                        "value":"world"
                    }
                }
            ]
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>There a few things worth pointing out:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the JSON returned is always an array of bind objects</li>
        <li>bind objects contain a varying amount of properties that reflect the evaluated state of the bound
            node (see required in above example). Properties will only be present if they have a non-default value
            to minimize the needed bandwidth</li>
        <li>a bind is identified by the bind id given by the corresponding <code>xf-bind</code> element
            ('b-greeting' and 'b-audience').</li>
        <li>each <code>xf-bind</code> MUST have an id</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The details of the JSON output is described in <a href="json.html">JSON format description.</a></p>

    <h2>Sending Updates</h2>

    <p>When the user interacts with the form the actions will be recorded in a list of changes that gets send
        to the server when appropriate.</p>

    <h3>Binding pathes</h3>

    <p>The client sends updates for changes in a flat JSON format that uses a 'binding path' to refer to the
        target node(s).</p>

    <div class="note">
        To avoid confusion Fore uses a simple syntax that is different from XPath. Remember - the client does not
        know about XPath in any way and it's domain shouldn't be polluted with foreign semantics.
    </div>

    <p>The structure of a "binding path" is extremely simple:</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            [BINDID | BINDID:INDEX] [/...]
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>For the simplest case there is just a bind id as path e.g.</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            foo
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>For the following <code>xf-bind</code> this would refer to an XML node 'bar':</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-bind id="foo" ref="bar"></xf-bind>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>For repeated elements (<code>xf-bind</code> with a <code>set</code> attribute) the path will contain the index of the target
        element devided by a ':' char e.g.</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            foo:3
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>Deeper pathes are build by separating steps with a / e.g.</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            foo:3/bar
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>which will correspond to the following bindings:</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-bind id="foo" set="foo">
                <xf-bind id="bar" ref="bar"></xf-bind>
            </xf-bind>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>When resolving the path it selects the bar element that is a child
        of the third 'foo' element in the default instance.</p>

    <h3>Value Changes</h3>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            [
                {
                    "action":"setvalue",
                    "path":"foo/bar"
                    "value":"newValue"
                }
            ]
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>sends an update request to update the nodes referred to by the bindings 'foo/bar'.</p>


    <h3>Appending a Repeat Item</h3>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            [
                {
                    "action":"append",
                    "path":"foo:3",
                    "modelItem": [
                        {
                            "id":"task",
                            "value":""
                        },
                        {
                            "id":"due",
                            "value":""
                        },
                        {
                            "id":"status",
                            "value":""
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>sends an update request to append an entry to the nodeset referred to by the binding 'foo'.
        Strictly speaking in this case the index would not be necessary but is provided anyway.
    </p>

    <h3>Other actions</h3>

    <p>Other possible actions are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>insert</li>
        <li>delete</li>
        <li>submit</li>
        <li>[dispatch]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are described in the <a href="../src/docs.html">API Docs</a>.</p>

    <h3>Receiving Updates from Server</h3>

    <p>When the user sends a value that in turn changes the state of other bound nodes this requires to
        return these state changes back to the client for processing.</p>

    <p>This can be either MIP changes (e.g. a node became relevant by a value update in another place),
        validation alerts or messages.</p>

    <p>The JSON format used for these updates is the same as above e.g.</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            [
                {
                    "action":"update",
                    "path":"foo/bar"
                    "relevant":false
                },
                {
                    "action":"message",
                    "text": "Your data have been stored",
                    "level": "modeless"
                }
            ]
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>
