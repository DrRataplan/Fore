    <h1>Writing forms</h1>


    <p>All Fore elements are HTML Custom Elements and are used as any other HTML element. A complete form
    will therefore be part of a larger HTML file.</p>

    <p>Please study the source code of the <a href="../demo/old/hello.html">Hello World</a> example to see a complete
        example document.</p>

    <h2>Document structure</h2>

    <p>There are 4 things to include for a working form:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>add the necessary imports</li>
        <li>add a <code>xf-model</code></li>
        <li>add a <code>xf-form</code></li>
        <li>add some UI controls</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>adding imports</h3>

    <p>Fore uses Web Components. First thing is to import the <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs" target="_blank">webcomponents polyfill</a> that makes sure
    that even older browsers that not yet implement the standard are supported.</p>

    <p>Next we have to load all components that are used on the page.</p>

    <p>Let's assume we just use 2 components:</p>
    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <!-- load web components polyfill -->
            <script src="../fore/assets/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"> </script>

            <script type="module">
                import '../fore/src/xf-form.js';
                import '../fore/src/xf-output.js';
            </script>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>The polyfill should always be the first script tag in the file. </p>

    <p>In the <code><script type="module"></script></code> section all <strong>UI Components</strong> must be added manually that
    are used on the page.</p>

    <div class="note">Eventually an auto-import gets added that will take away this burden.</div>

    <h3>Define a model</h3>

    <p>You might have asked yourself why we don't import a <code>xf-model</code> in the above example. The answer is that
    the <a href="xf-model.html">xf-model</a> element is not returned to the client at all. Instead it gets filtered out
    on the server when the request comes in. The model is only processed on the server and its details should not
    be exposed to the client at all.</p>


    <div class="note">As the model is not exposed on the client the use of HTML Custom Element syntax may be
    considered odd. However to keep consistency with the user interface markup the model elements also use Custom Element names.
    Usually model and user interface will be authored in a single file, so syntax consistency outweights other considerations here.</div>

    <p>A very simple model might look like this:</p>
    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-model>
                <xf-instance>
                    <data>
                        <greeting>World!</greeting>
                    </data>
                </xf-instance>
                <xf-bind id="b-greeting" ref="greeting" required="true()"></xf-bind>
            </xf-model>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>This  model defines a single instance with a piece of XML along with one binding that attaches
    to the 'greeting' node in the XML. It also add a 'required' facet to this node.</p>

    <p>The model can be placed anywhere in the document but would commonly occur at the beginning of the document body.</p>

    <p>More Information can be found on the <a href="xf-model.html">xf-model page.</a></p>

    <h3>Adding some UI</h3>

    <p>The controls are contained in a single element called <code>xf-form</code>. For our simplistic example
    this looks like this:</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-form>
                Hello <xf-output bind="b-greeting"></xf-output>
            </xf-form>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>There's only one control <code>xf-output</code> which binds to 'b-greeting' displaying its value. The form will
        display 'Hello World!'.</p>

    <h2>Important things to watch</h2>

    <p>If wondering which your form does not work please check these points:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Are all necessary module imports in place? Forms may silently fail to work when components are missing.</li>
        <li>Did you define at least one <code>xf-instance</code> in your model?</li>
        <li>All bindings need to have a unique id attribute</li>
        <li>There's one <code>xf-form</code> element present</li>
        <li>It contains Fore UI components that are bound with the correct ids</li>
    </ul>
