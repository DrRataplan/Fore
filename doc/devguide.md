## Using the eXist-db XPath/XQuery engine 

The initial reason to develop something like Fore was to replace betterFORM (with its dependency on specific Saxon version). This at the same time offers
some interesting potential for a new solution. By using the eXist-db builtin XPath engine we can easily upgrade to 
future enhancements of XPath, use our own ways of supporting custom functions as well as allow full XQuery support in
various places (e.g. calculations and submissions). This certainly offers a whole new level of processing power.
