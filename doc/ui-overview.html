        <h1>User Interface Overview</h1>

        <p>The User Interface (UI) is made of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/" target="_blank">Web Components</a>.
        The UI is enclosed by a single <code>xf-form</code> element. There are two kinds of components - simple controls and
        container controls. Controls are bound to data items via their <code>bind</code> attribute.</p>

        <p>Fore comes with a consistent, ready-made set of the most important components. However it is assumed that the
        collection grows driven by need. </p>

        <h2>Native Controls</h2>

        <p>Fore does not allow to directly use native controls like <code>input</code> or <code>select</code>.
        Instead these are wrapped into components with a <b>xf-</b> prefix (xf-input, xf-select,...).</p>

        <p>The reason for that is simple: it allows to attach the necessary logic for the consistent handling of state and
        makes sure that the control plays by the rules. This could have been applied to the native controls either but
        to the price of added complexity in the codebase.</p>

        <h2>Abstract Control</h2>

        <p>In Fore the <code>xf-abstract-control</code> implements the core of the data-binding and property updating already.
        All controls inherit from <code>XfAbstractControl</code> class and usually require minimal code to eventually
        attach custom eventhandlers or apply custom behavior for updating. New Components can thereby be added with very
        little effort.</p>

        <h2>Container Components</h2>

        <p>Container components may contain other container or simple components.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>

                parts of the UI.</td>
