    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>The following example model shows a very simple payment form.<sup>*</sup></p>
    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-model>
                <xf-instance>
                    <ecommerce>
                        <amount/>
                        <method/>
                        <number/>
                        <expiry/>
                    </ecommerce>
                </xf-instance>
                <xf-bind id="method" ref="method"> </xf-bind>
                <xf-bind id="number" ref="number"> </xf-bind>
                <xf-bind id="expiry" ref="expiry"> </xf-bind>
                <xf-submission action="module/handleSubmit()" method="post" id="submit"></xf-submission>
            </xf-model>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <h2>Example step-by-step</h2>

    <div class="note">
        Fore elements use the custom element syntax of HTML5 which requires a dash character
        in the name of the element. Fore custom elements use the prefix <b>'xf-'</b>.
    </div>

    <p>The example defines a single <code>xf-model</code> with one <code>xf-instance</code>, a couple
        of <code>xf-bind</code> elements and a submission. Together these make up the model of this form.</p>

    <p>
        The <a href="xf-model.html">model</a> defines the 'contract' of a form - which data it uses, the constraints which are applied to
        certain data items as well as how the submission of valid data is performed.
    </p>

    <p>In this model a single <a href="xf-instance.html">instance</a> is used. However a model can have as many instances as needed. An instance
        is considered a XML document and therefore needs to have a single rootnode.</p>

    <p>A <a href="xf-bind.html">bind</a> is used to attach constraints to one or multiple data items. In the example above no constraints
        are defined yet but there is one binding for each XML element in the instance.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>ref</code> attribute points to the node(s) in the instance that the
        bind attaches to. There is no need to add 'ecommerce' to the path as the context
        for the evaluation is always the root instance node ('ecommerce' here)</p>

    <p>The <a href="xf-submission">submission</a> element defines where to send the data when the user triggers a submit.</p>


    <p>In the next section the example will be refined and enhanced with some user interface controls.</p>

    <h2>Requiring values</h2>

    <p>Obviously it would be helpful if we can require the values for 'method', 'number' and 'expiry' to make
        sure the payment can be processed.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to do this is to add 'required' attributes to the bindings:</p>

    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-bind id="method" ref="method" required="true()"> </xf-bind>
            <xf-bind id="number" ref="number" required="true()"> </xf-bind>
            <xf-bind id="expiry" ref="expiry" required="true()"> </xf-bind>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>By adding <code>required="true()"</code> we added a constraint to each of the fields to be fulfilled before we can submit
        the data. The expression given in 'required' is interpreted as an <b>XPath</b> which returns a
        Boolean value.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
        Fore uses the <a href="https://github.com/FontoXML/fontoxpath">fontoXPath</a> engine which currently supports XPath 3.1 and XQuery 3.1.
    </div>

    <h2>Further constraints</h2>

    <p>Of course Fore can do more than simple requires. Consider the following refinement:</p>
    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            <xf-bind id="method" ref="method" required="true()"> </xf-bind>
            <xf-bind id="number" ref="number" relevant="../method = 'cc'" required="true()" type="my:ccnumber"> </xf-bind>
            <xf-bind id="expiry" ref="expiry" relevant="../method = 'cc'" required="true()" type="xs:gYearMonth"> </xf-bind>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <p>Let assume we have 'cash' or 'credit card' as payment methods. The bindings for 'number' and 'expiry' are only
    relevant in case the 'method' is 'cc' (for credit card).</p>

    <div class="note"><b>Relevance</b> is an important feature derived from XForms. By default
    each data item of an instance is relevant. However when nodes become non-relevant they are excluded from
    recalculations and revalidations. Also by default non-relevant nodes are not submitted. In the user interface
    all controls that bind to non-relevant nodes are hidden from view.</div>

    <p>'number' and 'expiry' also use datatypes to further ensure that values are of the correct format for further processing</p>

<!--    <div class="note">Fore forms are strongly typed. As datatypes the whole set of XSD Simple Types are supported.</div>-->

    <h2>Add some User Interface</h2>

    <p>Let's add some UI to make the form complete:</p>
    <demo-snippet>
        <template>
            Please pay: <xf-output bind="amount"> </xf-output>
            <xf-select bind="method" label="Payment Method">
                <xf-option value="cash">Cash</xf-option>
                <xf-option value="cc">Credit</xf-option>
            </xf-select>
            <xf-input bind="number" label="Card Number"/>
            <xf-input bind="expiry" label="Expiration Date"/>
            <xf-button>
                <xf-submit label="Submit"> </xf-submit>
            </xf-button>
        </template>
    </demo-snippet>

    <div class="note">
        This example uses Fore UI controls. <code>xf-select, xf-input etc.</code> which are simple wrappers around
        the native browser controls with added data-binding.
    </div>

    <p>Controls are bound to their corresponding data items via the <code>bind</code> attribute. This way controls
    get their value and state (e.g. whether it's readonly, required, valid or relevant). When the user selects
    'cc' the inputs for 'Card Number' and 'Expiration Date' will become relevant (displayed).</p>

    <p>the <code>xf-submit</code> finally will be triggered once the <code>xf-button</code> is clicked and send
    a signal to the model to revalidate the model, select the relevant nodes from the instance and send the data
    to the URI declared by <code>action</code></p>

    <h2>Where to go from here</h2>

    <p>The example above just touches the possiblities. To learn more about calculations, validations, actions
    and the vast possiblities of <code>submission</code> it is recommended to study the
    <a href="../demo/old/index.html">Demos</a> and the guide to <a href="writing-forms.html">writing forms</a>.</p>

    <p><sup>*</sup> the example has been taken from the XForms 2.0 specification</p>
